# MoodJournal

This mood tracker allows the user to log their mood rating, emotions, and journal entries reflecting their day! It is meant
to help the user become more attuned to how they're doing, and take a moment to slow down to care about themselves each day.

User Instructions:
    After pressing run on the program, the user can enter their data in two ways:
        1) Create entries one at a time (Menu option 1)
        2) Upload a series of entries from a file all at once (Menu option 8)
    If you decide to enter your data via txt file, the file must be in the format of comma separated values, the entries
    must be in the format: MONTH, MOOD RATING, JOURNAL ENTRY, EMOTIONS(comma separated).

An example of a properly formatted load file would look like this:
    10,5,the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy black dog,nervous,anxious,happy,excited
    4,10,peter piper picks a patch of pickled peppers,happy,excited
    4,3,twinkle twinkle little star,angry,lonely
    1,4,the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy black dog,sad
    12,5,peter piper picks a patch of pickled peppers,sad,nervous,busy
    3,7,ain't no mountain high enough,scared,joyful,grateful

Hope you enjoy using my mood tracker! :)
